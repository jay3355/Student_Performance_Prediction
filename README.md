# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
The Student Performance Prediction project focuses on analyzing student academic data to understand factors that affect their performance. The project uses information such as attendance, study hours, internal marks, and participation to identify patterns in student results. Basic data analysis and visualizations are used to gain insights, followed by a machine learning model that predicts whether a student will pass or fail. This project helps demonstrate how data science techniques can be applied to real-world educational problems to support better academic outcomes.
